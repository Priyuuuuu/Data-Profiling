STATISTICS EXPLANATION:

1. Count
•	Purpose: Determines the number of non-null entries in a column.
•	Why: Helps identify missing or incomplete data and assess data completeness.

2. Sum
•	Purpose: Total value of all entries in a numeric column.
•	Why: Useful for understanding total metrics, such as total sales or revenue.

3. Variance
•	Purpose: Measures the spread of data values.
•	Why: Indicates how data points deviate from the mean, which is critical for statistical analysis.

4. Standard Deviation
•	Purpose: Indicates data dispersion in the same units as the data.
•	Why: Helps identify variability and consistency in the data.

5. Mean
•	Purpose: Average value of the column.
•	Why: A central tendency measure, often used to summarize numeric data.

6. Median
•	Purpose: Middle value of the column when sorted.
•	Why: Provides a robust central tendency measure, unaffected by outliers.

7. Mode
•	Purpose: Most frequently occurring value in the column.
•	Why: Useful for categorical and skewed numeric data to identify common patterns.

8. Minimum and Maximum
•	Purpose: Lowest and highest values in the column.
•	Why: Defines the range and identifies potential outliers or anomalies.

9. Range
•	Purpose: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
•	Why: Offers a quick measure of the spread of data.

18. Percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th)
•	Purpose: Provides thresholds below which a certain percentage of data falls.
•	Why: Helps understand data distribution and detect skewness.

10. Skewness
•	Purpose: Measures data asymmetry.
•	Why: Indicates whether the data is skewed positively or negatively, which impacts statistical analysis.

11. Kurtosis
•	Purpose: Indicates data "peakedness" and tail heaviness.
•	Why: Helps detect outliers and assess the extremity of the distribution.

12. Null Values Count
•	Purpose: Total missing entries in a column.
•	Why: Highlights data quality issues and aids in handling missing data.

13. Datatype
•	Purpose: Identifies the data type (e.g., integer, float, object).
•	Why: Ensures compatibility with analysis and preprocessing techniques.

14. Unique Values
•	Purpose: Counts distinct values in a column.
•	Why: Helps identify categorical levels and detect duplicates.

15. Most Frequent Value
•	Purpose: Identifies the mode of the column.
•	Why: Useful for summarizing categorical data.

16. Length
•	Purpose: Measures the length of entries in string columns.
•	Why: Helps detect inconsistent formatting in textual data.

33. Typical Pattern
•	Purpose: Recognizes common patterns in data (e.g., phone numbers, emails).
•	Why: Aids in validating and cleaning structured textual data.
